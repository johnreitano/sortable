This is a code spike showing how one might manually sort items in a list using Javascript on the frontend and Ruby on the backend. The backend will reject moves that originate from an outdated list.

For the core code behavior, see the tests in [test/controllers/highlight_types_controller_test.rb](test/controllers/highlight_types_controller_test.rb).
